# Task: Professional Blue & White Redesign

## Objective
Update the application's visual identity from a dark, "lifeless" theme to a professional, vibrant Blue and White aesthetic. Simultaneously audit and fix non-functional buttons.

## Phase 1: Design System Refresh
- [ ] Update `src/styles/theme.css` with a professional blue palette.
- [ ] Define core color tokens for light and dark modes (prioritizing light mode as the primary professional look).
- [ ] Ensure typography is clean and professional.

## Phase 2: Core Layout & Navigation
- [ ] Redesign `MainLayout.tsx` and sidebar/navigation elements.
- [ ] Update `Login.tsx` to match the new professional aesthetic.
- [ ] Audit and fix navigation buttons in `MainLayout`.

## Phase 3: Dashboard & Primary Screens
- [ ] Redesign `TeacherDashboard.tsx` (remove hardcoded dark backgrounds, use tokens).
- [ ] Redesign `StudentDashboard.tsx`.
- [ ] Fix any "dead" buttons in these dashboards.

## Phase 4: Specialist Components
- [ ] Update `ActivityCreator.tsx` (preserving the readability improvements but adapting colors).
- [ ] Redesign `ClassManagement.tsx`, `Grading.tsx`, and `Reports.tsx`.

## Phase 5: Verification & Polishing
- [ ] Full functional sweep of all interactive elements.
- [ ] Add subtle animations (Framer Motion) to enhance the "professional" feel.
- [ ] Final UI/UX audit.

## Verification Criteria
- [ ] Application background is clean off-white/light blue.
- [ ] Primary buttons and accents are vibrant Blue.
- [ ] All buttons trigger their intended actions.
- [ ] Interface feels premium and high-end rather than a simple MVP.
